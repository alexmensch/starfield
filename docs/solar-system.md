# Solar-system layer

Solar-system layer (`stellata-3re`). When a focusable star carries a planet
system, Stellata renders the planets as billboarded discs at their
heliocentric positions, faint orbit rings on the host's orbital plane,
and (Sol only) the heliopause boundary as a translucent asymmetric
shell. Sol is the only populated host in v1; the framework is
deliberately generic so the future exoplanet epic (`stellata-bk5`)
can plug in without changing the renderer.

## Data model

`planet-system.ts` defines the contract every host's planet system
satisfies:

- `Planet` — name, equatorial radius (km), semi-major axis (AU),
  eccentricity, type (`rocky` / `gas_giant` / `ice_giant`),
  representative RGB colour.
- `PlanetSystem` — host star catalog index, `planets` array,
  optional `positionsAt(t, out)` resolver writing 3 floats per planet
  in the host's local orbital-plane frame, optional
  `orbitOrientations` for the orbit-ring renderer.

Sync probe: `hasPlanets(catalog, idx)` — v1 hardwires "planets ⇔ Sol".
Async resolver: `getPlanetSystem(catalog, idx)` returns the system or
`null`. The Promise wrapper is intentional so `bk5` can lazily fetch
per-host JSON shards without changing the call sites.

`SOL_PLANETS` is the eight major planets + Pluto with constants
sourced from NASA Planetary Fact Sheets (radii) and JPL DE440 (mean
elements at J2000). Pluto comes from New Horizons 2015 reconnaissance.
See `SCIENCE.md` §Solar system for the citation rationale.

## Ephemerides

`ephemeris.ts` implements the **JPL Standish 1992 Keplerian-elements
approximation** with the cubic Jupiter–Neptune correction terms
(Table 2a/2b inlined). Sub-arcminute accuracy 3000 BC – 3000 AD,
which is overkill for billboarded discs that floor at ~2 px regardless
of zoom. VSOP87 was rejected during 3re.3: the precision difference is
invisible at user-reachable framings and the dependency cost was not
worth it. Deep-time (sub-arcminute outside Standish's window) is filed
as `stellata-1gh`.

Returned positions are heliocentric **ecliptic** parsecs, not ICRS —
the rotation onto ICRS happens in the caller via the per-host
orbital-plane orientation quaternion. Sol's quaternion is the J2000
obliquity rotation; future exoplanet hosts (`bk5`) get a galactic-
plane-aligned default per the 3re.8 rule below.

Per-`t` cache granularity is 60 seconds. At billboarded-disc pixel
scale, sub-minute planet motion is invisible — Mercury moves ~3e-5 rad
seen from Earth over 60 s, well below pixel resolution at any zoom we
afford. The cache key is `t / CACHE_GRANULARITY_SEC` floored, so
multiple frames within the same minute reuse the same `Vec3` triplet.
A future time scrubber (`stellata-nmu`) reducing the granularity to
sub-second is straightforward — the cache key just bucketises finer.

## Time `t` and the readout

`time.ts` defines `t` as a Unix-seconds double. v1 pins it to "now"
via `Stellata.getT()` returning `Date.now() / 1000`; the time scrubber
(`stellata-nmu`) plugs in via `Stellata.setT()`.

`time-readout.ts` renders the live UTC timestamp the planet positions
correspond to in `.ui-bottom`'s `#time-readout`. Visibility tracks two
gates:

1. The focused star carries a planet system (`hasPlanets`).
2. No camera transition (warp / observe-enter / observe-exit) is in
   flight — the readout would flash mid-warp otherwise.

Format is UTC Zulu: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC`. `isLive(t)` is true
when `|t − now| < 1 s`; in that case the readout appends "(live)".
Once a scrubber lands, scrubbed values drop the suffix.

`t` is **independent of `uTime`**. `uTime` is the cosmetic clock that
drives variable-star pulsation and keeps ticking at
`uSecondsPerDay = 0.2` regardless of what `t` is. Variable-star phase
must never read from `t`.

## Planet rendering

`star-system.ts` owns the per-host orbit rings + planet bodies layer.
Each frame, when a planet system is attached:

1. Call the system's `positionsAt(t, scratch)` to refresh local-frame
   positions (or fall back to a static placeholder if absent).
2. Apply the per-host orientation quaternion to rotate from local
   orbital-plane → ICRS.
3. Upload positions to the planet billboard mesh as instance
   attributes.

Planets are rendered as billboarded discs (similar to stars). The
fragment shader hard-edges the disc — no halo, no extended
atmosphere, no banding, no axial-tilt cue. Detail rendering is
**deliberately deferred** to the planet-zoom epic (`stellata-2f6`):
at every camera-to-body distance the user can currently reach, every
planet floors at the disc-pixel minimum (~2 px), so per-texture
detail would be invisible regardless of how much shader work goes
into it. See the `defer-detail-until-zoom-affordance` rule in
`CLAUDE.md`.

`planet-labels.ts` draws per-planet body-anchored SVG labels above
the canvas. The label engine is independent of the chart-mode label
engine (`chart-labels.ts`); planet labels are always-on when a planet
system is attached, and hidden in chart mode so the chart-mode glyph
contract isn't doubled up.

## Orbit rings

The orbit-ring layer (`star-system.ts` again) draws each planet's
orbit as an ellipse with the host star at one focus. Geometry:
`b = a · √(1 − e²)`, focal offset `c = a · e`. v1 places the
perihelion along the local +x axis as a placeholder; per-planet
longitude-of-perihelion landed alongside Standish elements in 3re.13.

Ring visibility is gated on an angular-separation heuristic so
distant host stars don't spam invisible rings into the framebuffer.

### Orbital plane convention

Per the 3re.8 design rule:

- **Sol's orbit rings sit on the ecliptic.** The host orientation
  quaternion rotates the local plane so +Z aligns with the ecliptic
  pole (J2000 obliquity ε = 23.4392911°). This matches what an
  observer at Sol sees on the sky.
- **All other host stars' orbit rings sit on the galactic plane.**
  Exoplanet system orientations are not generally known; aligning to
  the galactic plane gives a consistent visual "this star has
  planets" cue without implying a measured orientation we don't have.

The per-host quaternion is composed once at `getPlanetSystem` attach
time and reused for both the body positions and the ring renderer.
Ring renderer composes `Rz(Ω) · Rx(I) · Rz(ω)` per planet (from the
Sol-only `orbitOrientations` array, when present) before the
host-plane → ICRS rotation, so rings line up with the body positions
emitted by `positionsAt`.

## Heliopause boundary

`heliopause.ts` and the matching shaders. Asymmetric ellipsoid centred
on Sol, aligned to the solar apex of motion through the local
interstellar medium. Geometry is fixed (no `t` dependence on human
timescales):

- Upwind boundary at **122 AU** — Voyager 1, 2012-08-25.
- Flank at **115 AU** — Voyager 2, 2018-11-05.
- Heliotail at **200 AU** — IBEX / Cassini ENA estimate.
- Apex direction: ICRS RA 17h53m, Dec +27.4°, after Frisch & Slavin
  2013.

Construction: unit sphere → scale to (115, 115, 161) AU → translate
the centre 39 AU toward antiapex → rotate so +Z lands on the antiapex.
Result: upwind apex at +122 AU, downwind at −200 AU along the apex.

Rendering uses a Fresnel limb-darkening fragment shader: alpha peaks
at the silhouette where the view ray grazes the surface and falls to
a small floor face-on, so the upwind apex region doesn't paint the
shell as a flat disc against the starfield. Back-face culling means
the shell disappears from inside (Sol focus, zoomed in) — this is
intentional, since from inside there's nothing geometrically
informative to show.

The "Heliopause" SVG label is anchored to the upwind apex's projected
silhouette by `createHeliopauseLabel` in `main.ts`. Visibility tracks
the same orbit-ring heuristic so the label disappears in lockstep
with the planet labels when the host system is too far for the
geometry to read.

## First-load default and `minDistance` relaxation

When the URL carries no view state, `first-load.ts` applies a
canonical `FIRST_LOAD_VIEW`: camera parked at exactly **5 AU** from
Sol aimed at the galactic centre, with the HUD ring on. Sol stays
the default focus; no constellation highlight is set so the bulge
shines through cleanly without an asterism layered over the brightest
patch of sky. The view is applied via `applyDecodedView` from
`url-state.ts` — the same pipeline used for `?v=` URL restores —
which keeps the "first interaction is the first URL write" contract
intact: `startUrlSync` seeds its frame-tracking baseline from the
live camera state on registration, so the URL stays empty until the
user actually moves the camera or changes a setting.

The Stellata constructor calls `setFocus(catalog.solIndex)` to
recentre the local frame on Sol but does not park the camera —
both bootstrap paths (`applyFirstLoadView` for the bare URL, and
`applyFromUrl` for `?v=` URLs) own the cam pose end-to-end and
run before first paint in `main.ts`.

Other arrival flows (warp, observe-exit, search-select) use
`minDistForStar` — only the bare-URL bootstrap reads
`first-load.ts`.

When focused on Sol, `controls.minDistance` drops to
`minOrbitDistForStar(Sol) ≈ 0.011 AU` so the user can fly into the
inner solar system and resolve individual planets. This is safe
specifically because Sol sits at the world origin — the float32
jitter that bites at small distances *from non-origin focal stars*
doesn't apply when the focal frame is also the world frame. Other
focal stars retain the global `0.005 pc` (~1031 AU) floor.

`camera.near` is at `1e-10 pc` — well below `minOrbitDistForStar` —
so very-close planet inspection isn't culled. The strict-less-than
`camera.near < minDistance` invariant holds.

## Gotchas

- **Ecliptic ↔ equatorial obliquity.** Use J2000 ε = 23.4392911°
  consistently when composing the Sol-host quaternion. Do not reach
  for the time-varying obliquity term — Standish's accuracy budget
  doesn't need it and the apparent-position match is unaffected.
- **`t` vs `uTime`.** Variable-star pulsation is cosmetic — it must
  never depend on `t`. The two clocks are deliberately decoupled.
- **Per-focus minDistance override.** When focus switches *away*
  from Sol, the floor must snap back to `0.005 pc` *before* the new
  focus's recenter pulls the camera in. `setFocus` is the right hook
  and already handles this; any new focus path must as well.
- **Planet-system attach is async.** `getPlanetSystem` is a Promise
  even for Sol (which resolves synchronously in v1). Don't assume the
  system is attached the same frame `setFocus` fires; the renderer
  handles `planetSystem === null` gracefully.
- **Heliopause label visibility.** Hidden when the camera is inside
  the shell or when the host is not Sol. Don't add a "show always"
  toggle without thinking through the dual gating.
- **Orbital plane rule for new hosts.** Any new planet-bearing host
  must declare its plane via the orientation quaternion. The default
  for non-Sol hosts is the galactic plane — don't accidentally
  default to the ecliptic.
