# Build and data

The build pipeline that turns the raw catalogues in `data/` into
renderer-ready binaries in `public/`. Everything in this doc is about
`scripts/*` and the file formats they produce. For the science of *what*
gets computed (Stefan–Boltzmann radii, etc.), see `SCIENCE.md`.

## Binary catalog format (`public/catalog.bin`)

Fixed-size records, sorted brightest-first by `absmag`. Current version is
**v4** with a 44-byte stride. Magic and version step together
(v3=`HYG3`, v4=`HYG4`). v4 added a `uint32` HIP at bytes 40–43 so the
URL-state encoder can use Hipparcos numbers as stable star IDs that
survive future catalog reorderings.

- Header (32 bytes)
  - 0–3   ASCII `HYG4`
  - 4–7   `uint32` version (currently 4)
  - 8–11  `uint32` count
  - 12–15 `uint32` nameTableOffset
  - 16–19 `uint32` nameTableLength
  - 20–31 reserved
- Record (44 bytes per star)
  - 0–11  `float32 × 3`  x, y, z in parsecs (equatorial, Sol at origin)
  - 12–15 `float32`      absmag
  - 16–19 `float32`      ci (B–V colour index, default 0.65 for missing)
  - 20–23 `float32`      physicalRadius in solar radii (computed at build time)
  - 24–27 `uint32`       companionIdx (record index of binary companion; `0xFFFFFFFF` = none)
  - 28–31 `uint32`       nameOffset (into name table, valid when flag bit 0 set; `0` = none)
  - 32    `uint8`        spectClass (0=O 1=B 2=A 3=F 4=G 5=K 6=M 7=C/S/W 8=?)
  - 33    `uint8`        luminosityClass (0=VII/D … 9=Ia+/0, 255=unknown — see below)
  - 34    `uint8`        constellation index (0–87 into `constellations.json`; 255=none)
  - 35    `uint8`        flags (bit 0=has_name, 1=is_sol, 2=has_bayer, 4=is_binary_primary)
  - 36    `uint8`        **variability amplitude** in 0.05 mag units (0 = not variable)
  - 37    `uint8`        reserved (future: variability type)
  - 38–39 `uint16`       **variability period** in 0.1 days (0 = not variable, max 6553.5 d)
  - 40–43 `uint32`       **HIP** (Hipparcos number; 0 = no HIP). Only ~37%
                          of the catalogue carries HIP — the rest are filled
                          with 0 and fall back to row-index addressing in
                          shared URLs. Max observed HIP is 120,404 (fits in
                          17 bits) so 24 bits would suffice, but `uint32`
                          keeps the record stride a multiple of 4.
- Name table: length-prefixed UTF-8 strings (`uint16` length then bytes).
  **Offset 0 is reserved** as the "no name" sentinel (2 zero bytes of
  padding); real names start at offset ≥ 2.

Luminosity class encoding (Morgan–Keenan):
`0=VII/D (white dwarf), 1=VI/sd, 2=V (dwarf), 3=IV (subgiant), 4=III
(giant), 5=II (bright giant), 6=Ib, 7=Iab, 8=Ia, 9=Ia+/0 (hypergiant),
255=unknown`.

Amplitude encoding saturates at 255 × 0.05 = 12.75 mag; periods over
6553.5 days clamp to the uint16 max. Both limits cover the vast
majority of real variables (a few multi-decade symbiotics and extreme
eclipsers clip but those render imperceptibly slowly anyway).

If you add fields, keep the 44-byte stride (pad as needed) and **bump
`version`** (and the matching magic) in both the writer and reader.

## Search index (`public/search-index.json`)

Separate from `catalog.bin` so the main binary stays rendering-focused.
One JSON array entry per star that has at least one searchable identifier
(proper name, Bayer, Flamsteed, HIP, HD, HR, or Gliese). Short keys
(`i/p/b/f/hip/hd/hr/gl/c/s`) to keep wire size down — file is ~13 MB raw,
~2 MB gzipped. Loaded in parallel with `catalog.bin` in `main.ts`. The
`s` field carries the raw spectral designation from the AT-HYG source
("G2 V", "M1.5Iab-b", "K0III+K7V", …) for the hover tooltip display.

Identifier dispatch in `search.ts`:
- Regex-prefix forms (`HIP 27989`, `HD 39801`, `HR 2061`, `Gl 559A`) go
  through `Map<number, number>` direct lookups — no fuzzy scoring.
- Flamsteed (`58 Ori`) also uses a direct `"${num} ${con}"` map.
- Everything else (proper name, Bayer forms) is Fuse-fuzzy.
- For each Bayer'd star, multiple index entries are emitted so any of
  `α Cen` / `Alpha Cen` / `Alp Cen` / `Alf Cen` / `Alpha Centaurus` find
  the star. "Alf" is added only for α (most-commonly alternate-spelled).

The dropdown deduplicates by star index so a star with multiple matching
Bayer variants shows up once.

## Stick figures from Stellarium

Classical asterism lines are sourced from Stellarium's modern sky culture
`index.json` (CC/MIT-compatible, HIP-indexed). The source file is
committed to `data/stellarium-modern-skyculture.json` — it essentially
never changes, so fetching it at build time each time would be wasted
work.

Pipeline in `scripts/build-catalog.ts`:

1. The HYG CSV parser reads the `hip` column into each star record.
2. After sorting stars by absmag (so record indices are final), a
   `hipToIndex: Map<number, number>` is built from the post-sort order.
   Duplicate HIPs (rare — binary companions) keep the brightest entry
   (first-write wins).
3. `buildFigureLines(hipToIndex)` walks each Stellarium constellation's
   `lines` array and resolves every HIP to a record index, producing
   `Map<conIndex, number[][]>`.
4. Resolved `lines` are merged into the emitted `constellations.json`
   alongside `{ code, name }`. A polyline is kept only if ≥2 points
   survive.

**Reliability rule: any unresolved HIP is a hard build error** — unless
it's in `KNOWN_MISSING_HIPS`. That map documents HIPs that Stellarium
references but HYG has no 3D position for (empty x/y/z/parallax in the
CSV), with a human-readable justification each. Currently:

- `5165` (α Phe / Ankaa) — Phoenix loses most of its figure without this
  star, but HYG can't carry it.
- `89341` (μ Sgr / Polis) — one Sagittarius polyline degrades from 3
  points to 2, shape still recognisable.

If a future Stellarium update introduces new references to missing HIPs,
the build fails until each is explicitly added to
`KNOWN_MISSING_HIPS` with rationale. Don't relax the check to a soft
warning — the whole point of using Stellarium's HIP-indexed data (vs.
fuzzy RA/Dec position matching) is deterministic mapping.

## Physical radius and spectral parsing

`parseSpectral` in `build-catalog.ts` walks tolerant regexes over the (often
messy) AT-HYG `spect` string to extract `{ classIdx, subclass, lumClass,
isWhiteDwarf }`. It handles the common pathological forms seen in the
catalog (composite `"K0III+K6V"`, prefix colons, ranges like `"F5-F9"`,
subdwarf `sdB`, white-dwarf `DA2`, etc.) by using prefix-anchored matches
for the luminosity numeral and falling back to `lumClass=255` when no
pattern matches.

`physicalRadius` then computes R/R☉ via Stefan–Boltzmann:

```
T       = interp(T_TABLE[classIdx], subclass)
BC      = interp(BC_TABLE[classIdx], subclass)
Mbol    = absmag + BC
L/L☉    = 10^((4.74 − Mbol) / 2.5)
R/R☉    = sqrt(L/L☉) × (T_sun/T)²
```

Tables are main-sequence values — cooler for giants/supergiants in reality
— but the Mbol side of the equation absorbs the luminosity-class
difference, so the end result lands close to published radii (Sol≈1.03,
Sirius≈1.81, Vega≈2.68, Rigel≈75, Betelgeuse≈700, all within ~10% of
canonical values). Clamped to `[0.08, 2500]` so pathological catalog
rows don't produce absurd sizes. White dwarfs are special-cased to
0.013 R☉ (typical WD radius; absmag doesn't translate reliably for them).

## Geometric binary inference

`inferBinaries` in `build-catalog.ts` runs after the absmag sort so record
indices are final. Spatial grid keyed at `BINARY_MAX_SEP_PC = 0.005 pc`
(≈1030 AU) using a three-axis hash; for each star, check own cell + 26
neighbours and record the nearest neighbour within the threshold.

Why this threshold: at the current `minDistance = 0.005 pc` orbit,
anything farther than that subtends >45° from the camera — it wouldn't
fit the viewport as a visual "system", which is what the render layer
wants. Wider bound pairs exist in the catalog but won't render usefully.

What you'll see from the classic_ids subset: ~14 pairs. Feels low but is
accurate. The subset selects stars with classical designations, and most
"wide binary" companions in physically-bound pairs don't have their own
classical ID — the brighter primary does. The pairs we do find are
almost all famous named visual binaries (α Cen A/B, Alula Australis,
Struve 2398, etc.). Reaching thousands of pairs would require the fuller
`reduced_m10` subset, which has a different selection profile.

Each side of a pair stores the other's index in `companionIdx`. The
**brighter** of the two (lower absmag) is flagged as primary via flag
bit 4, so the renderer can quickly identify system anchors.

## GCVS variability cross-match

`parseGcvsMain` + `parseGcvsCrossref` in `build-catalog.ts` read two
files from `data/`:

- `gcvs5.txt` — pipe-delimited fixed-width; we pull the GCVS designation,
  period (days), and magnitude amplitude (from max-mag / min-mag-I).
  Rows without a parseable period, or with zero amplitude, are skipped
  (constant stars, supernovae, irregular variables we can't render
  periodically).
- `crossid.txt` — maps foreign-catalogue IDs (`Hip nnnn`, `HD nnnn`, …)
  to GCVS designations. Only `Hip` and `HD` are extracted since AT-HYG
  carries those.

`applyVariability` then walks the post-sort catalog and for each star
tries HIP first, HD fallback, to find a GCVS name, then looks up the
period+amp. Typical match rate: ~3.7k out of 313k classic_ids stars —
most catalog stars aren't variable, but the ones that are tend to be
the astronomically interesting ones (Betelgeuse, Mira, Algol,
Cepheids, etc.).

Both GCVS files are tracked via Git LFS rather than downloaded at build
time — they update rarely (yearly-ish). If bumping to a new GCVS
version, re-download from http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/ and replace the
existing files; LFS handles the large-blob storage on push.

## Preprocessor idempotency

`scripts/build-catalog.ts isUpToDate` skips rebuild if `catalog.bin`,
`constellations.json`, **and** `search-index.json` are newer than all
source inputs (AT-HYG CSV, Stellarium JSON, GCVS files, and the script
itself). If you change field mapping but not the script mtime (e.g.
edit in a way that updates atime only), you may need to
`touch scripts/build-catalog.ts` or delete the generated files.
