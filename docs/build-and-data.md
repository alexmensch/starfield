# Build and data

The build pipeline that turns the raw catalogues in `data/` into
renderer-ready binaries in `public/`. Everything in this doc is about
`scripts/*` and the file formats they produce. For the science of *what*
gets computed (Stefan–Boltzmann radii, etc.), see `SCIENCE.md`.

## Frozen external data

External scientific catalogs in Stellata's pipeline (stellar, ISM,
nebular, exoplanetary, …) are committed under `data/` and read from
disk at build time. The build does NOT fetch from the network — no
`requests.get`, `urllib`, `astroquery`, or `fetch` calls participate in
`npm run build` or the Python preprocessors.

Why: the build keeps working long-term even when external sources go
offline, change schemas, or move URLs. Existing pattern reflects this
across every input — `athyg_33_classic_ids.csv`, `gcvs5.txt`,
`crossid.txt`, `stellarium-modern-skyculture.json`, Edenhofer dust via
committed `data/dust/*.bin`, Pace 2024 LVDB
`data/local-group/lvdb-snapshot.csv`, Hipparcos `data/hip_ccdm.tsv`.
Refresh from upstream is an explicit, manual, infrequent step, not a
build dependency.

When adding new external data:

1. Fetch once (manually or via a one-shot helper) and commit the raw
   file under `data/`. Files over ~1 MB ride Git LFS (see the existing
   AT-HYG / GCVS / Edenhofer entries; the LVDB snapshot is under the
   threshold and rides regular git).
2. Document the source URL + retrieval date in `SCIENCE.md` § Data
   sources.
3. Build scripts read from `data/<file>`. They do not hit the network.
4. If you write a fetch helper, name it explicitly (e.g.
   `scripts/refresh-clouds.py`) and gate it from `npm run build` —
   refresh is a separate command, not a build step.

Applies to JSON / CSV / FITS / HDF5 / TSV catalogs, sky-culture JSON,
dust map binaries — anything sourced from outside the repo.

## Binary catalog format (`public/catalog.bin`)

Fixed-size records, sorted brightest-first by `absmag`. Current version is
**v4** with a 44-byte stride. Magic and version step together
(v3=`HYG3`, v4=`HYG4`). v4 added a `uint32` HIP at bytes 40–43 so the
URL-state encoder can use Hipparcos numbers as stable star IDs that
survive future catalog reorderings.

- Header (32 bytes)
  - 0–3   ASCII `HYG4`
  - 4–7   `uint32` version (currently 4)
  - 8–11  `uint32` count
  - 12–15 `uint32` nameTableOffset
  - 16–19 `uint32` nameTableLength
  - 20–31 reserved
- Record (44 bytes per star)
  - 0–11  `float32 × 3`  x, y, z in parsecs (equatorial, Sol at origin)
  - 12–15 `float32`      absmag
  - 16–19 `float32`      ci (B–V colour index, default 0.65 for missing)
  - 20–23 `float32`      physicalRadius in solar radii (computed at build time)
  - 24–27 `uint32`       companionIdx (record index of binary companion; `0xFFFFFFFF` = none)
  - 28–31 `uint32`       nameOffset (into name table, valid when flag bit 0 set; `0` = none)
  - 32    `uint8`        spectClass (0=O 1=B 2=A 3=F 4=G 5=K 6=M 7=C/S/W 8=?)
  - 33    `uint8`        luminosityClass (0=VII/D … 9=Ia+/0, 255=unknown — see below)
  - 34    `uint8`        constellation index (0–87 into `constellations.json`; 255=none)
  - 35    `uint8`        flags (bit 0=has_name, 1=is_sol, 2=has_bayer, 4=is_binary_primary)
  - 36    `uint8`        **variability amplitude** in 0.05 mag units (0 = not variable)
  - 37    `uint8`        reserved (future: variability type)
  - 38–39 `uint16`       **variability period** in 0.1 days (0 = not variable, max 6553.5 d)
  - 40–43 `uint32`       **HIP** (Hipparcos number; 0 = no HIP). Only ~37%
                          of the catalogue carries HIP — the rest are filled
                          with 0 and fall back to row-index addressing in
                          shared URLs. Max observed HIP is 120,404 (fits in
                          17 bits) so 24 bits would suffice, but `uint32`
                          keeps the record stride a multiple of 4.
- Name table: length-prefixed UTF-8 strings (`uint16` length then bytes).
  **Offset 0 is reserved** as the "no name" sentinel (2 zero bytes of
  padding); real names start at offset ≥ 2.

Luminosity class encoding (Morgan–Keenan):
`0=VII/D (white dwarf), 1=VI/sd, 2=V (dwarf), 3=IV (subgiant), 4=III
(giant), 5=II (bright giant), 6=Ib, 7=Iab, 8=Ia, 9=Ia+/0 (hypergiant),
255=unknown`.

Amplitude encoding saturates at 255 × 0.05 = 12.75 mag; periods over
6553.5 days clamp to the uint16 max. Both limits cover the vast
majority of real variables (a few multi-decade symbiotics and extreme
eclipsers clip but those render imperceptibly slowly anyway).

The byte plan above is encoded once in `scripts/catalog-pure.ts` as
`HEADER_LAYOUT`, `RECORD_LAYOUT`, `HEADER_SIZE`, `RECORD_SIZE`, `MAGIC`,
`BINARY_VERSION`, and `NO_COMPANION`. Writer (`scripts/build-catalog.ts`),
runtime reader (`src/client/catalog-loader.ts`), and the verify tool
(`scripts/verify-catalog.ts`) all index off those constants — there are
no inline byte offsets to drift apart. If you add fields, keep the
44-byte stride (pad as needed), extend `RECORD_LAYOUT`, and **bump
`BINARY_VERSION` + `MAGIC`** in `catalog-pure.ts`. Free flag bits today
are `0x08`, `0x20`, `0x40`, `0x80` (see `FLAG_*` exports). Layout
consistency is pinned by the `binary-format constants` block in
`scripts/catalog-pure.test.ts`.

The build script also asserts every headline count (record count, GCVS
xrefs, binary inference output, CCDM doubles, name-table entries,
search-index entries, etc.) against
`scripts/build-catalog-expected.json` at the end of each run. A
deliberate change refreshes the manifest with
`UPDATE_BUILD_COUNTS=1 npm run build:catalog`; an unintended drift
exits non-zero with a per-key diff. `scripts/build-counts.ts` carries
the pure comparator + formatter and has its own vitest coverage.

## Search index (`public/search-index.json`)

Separate from `catalog.bin` so the main binary stays rendering-focused.
One JSON array entry per star that has at least one searchable identifier
(proper name, Bayer, Flamsteed, HIP, HD, HR, or Gliese). Short keys
(`i/p/b/f/hip/hd/hr/gl/c/s`) to keep wire size down — file is ~13 MB raw,
~2 MB gzipped. Loaded in parallel with `catalog.bin` in `main.ts`. The
`s` field carries the raw spectral designation from the AT-HYG source
("G2 V", "M1.5Iab-b", "K0III+K7V", …) for the hover tooltip display.

Field shape pinned in `scripts/catalog-pure.ts` as the `SearchEntry`
interface — the writer (`build-catalog.ts`) and the reader
(`src/client/search.ts`) both import it; drift = compile error.

Identifier dispatch in `search.ts`:
- Regex-prefix forms (`HIP 27989`, `HD 39801`, `HR 2061`, `Gl 559A`) go
  through `Map<number, number>` direct lookups — no fuzzy scoring.
- Flamsteed (`58 Ori`) also uses a direct `"${num} ${con}"` map.
- Everything else (proper name, Bayer forms) is Fuse-fuzzy.
- For each Bayer'd star, multiple index entries are emitted so any of
  `α Cen` / `Alpha Cen` / `Alp Cen` / `Alf Cen` / `Alpha Centaurus` find
  the star. "Alf" is added only for α (most-commonly alternate-spelled).

The dropdown deduplicates by star index so a star with multiple matching
Bayer variants shows up once.

## Stick figures from Stellarium

Classical asterism lines are sourced from Stellarium's modern sky culture
`index.json` (CC/MIT-compatible, HIP-indexed). The source file is
committed to `data/stellarium-modern-skyculture.json` — it essentially
never changes, so fetching it at build time each time would be wasted
work.

Pipeline in `scripts/build-catalog.ts`:

1. The HYG CSV parser reads the `hip` column into each star record.
2. After sorting stars by absmag (so record indices are final), a
   `hipToIndex: Map<number, number>` is built from the post-sort order.
   Duplicate HIPs (rare — binary companions) keep the brightest entry
   (first-write wins).
3. `buildFigureLines(hipToIndex)` walks each Stellarium constellation's
   `lines` array and resolves every HIP to a record index, producing
   `Map<conIndex, number[][]>`.
4. Resolved `lines` are merged into the emitted `constellations.json`
   alongside `{ code, name }`. A polyline is kept only if ≥2 points
   survive.

**Reliability rule: any unresolved HIP is a hard build error** — unless
it's in `KNOWN_MISSING_HIPS`. That map documents HIPs that Stellarium
references but HYG has no 3D position for (empty x/y/z/parallax in the
CSV), with a human-readable justification each. Currently:

- `5165` (α Phe / Ankaa) — Phoenix loses most of its figure without this
  star, but HYG can't carry it.
- `89341` (μ Sgr / Polis) — one Sagittarius polyline degrades from 3
  points to 2, shape still recognisable.

If a future Stellarium update introduces new references to missing HIPs,
the build fails until each is explicitly added to
`KNOWN_MISSING_HIPS` with rationale. Don't relax the check to a soft
warning — the whole point of using Stellarium's HIP-indexed data (vs.
fuzzy RA/Dec position matching) is deterministic mapping.

## Physical radius and spectral parsing

`parseSpectral` in `build-catalog.ts` walks tolerant regexes over the (often
messy) AT-HYG `spect` string to extract `{ classIdx, subclass, lumClass,
isWhiteDwarf }`. It handles the common pathological forms seen in the
catalog (composite `"K0III+K6V"`, prefix colons, ranges like `"F5-F9"`,
subdwarf `sdB`, white-dwarf `DA2`, etc.) by using prefix-anchored matches
for the luminosity numeral and falling back to `lumClass=255` when no
pattern matches.

`physicalRadius` then computes R/R☉ via Stefan–Boltzmann:

```
T       = interp(T_TABLE[classIdx], subclass)
BC      = interp(BC_TABLE[classIdx], subclass)
Mbol    = absmag + BC
L/L☉    = 10^((4.74 − Mbol) / 2.5)
R/R☉    = sqrt(L/L☉) × (T_sun/T)²
```

Tables are main-sequence values — cooler for giants/supergiants in reality
— but the Mbol side of the equation absorbs the luminosity-class
difference, so the end result lands close to published radii (Sol≈1.03,
Sirius≈1.81, Vega≈2.68, Rigel≈75, Betelgeuse≈700, all within ~10% of
canonical values). Clamped to `[0.08, 2500]` so pathological catalog
rows don't produce absurd sizes. White dwarfs are special-cased to
0.013 R☉ (typical WD radius; absmag doesn't translate reliably for them).

## Geometric binary inference

`inferBinaries` in `build-catalog.ts` runs after the absmag sort so record
indices are final. Spatial grid keyed at `BINARY_MAX_SEP_PC = 0.005 pc`
(≈1030 AU) using a three-axis hash; for each star, check own cell + 26
neighbours and record the nearest neighbour within the threshold.

Why this threshold: at the current `minDistance = 0.005 pc` orbit,
anything farther than that subtends >45° from the camera — it wouldn't
fit the viewport as a visual "system", which is what the render layer
wants. Wider bound pairs exist in the catalog but won't render usefully.

What you'll see from the classic_ids subset: ~14 pairs. Feels low but is
accurate. The subset selects stars with classical designations, and most
"wide binary" companions in physically-bound pairs don't have their own
classical ID — the brighter primary does. The pairs we do find are
almost all famous named visual binaries (α Cen A/B, Alula Australis,
Struve 2398, etc.). Reaching thousands of pairs would require the fuller
`reduced_m10` subset, which has a different selection profile.

Each star records its **directed** nearest in `companionIdx`: A's
nearest may be B while B's nearest is some third star C. The
relation is one-way. The renderer reads this as "the partner to keep
in frame" (zoom-fit, disc-mask), which is well-defined even when
asymmetric.

Flag bit 4 (`0x10`) is stricter: set only on the **brighter member of
a mutual pair** — A↔B where each is the other's directed nearest.
Mutual-only avoids over-flagging in dense clusters where a star's
directed nearest happens to be a third star already paired with
someone else, and ensures the chart-mode wings glyph appears once
per system on the canonical anchor.

## GCVS variability cross-match

`parseGcvsMain` + `parseGcvsCrossref` in `build-catalog.ts` read two
files from `data/`:

- `gcvs5.txt` — pipe-delimited fixed-width; we pull the GCVS designation,
  period (days), and magnitude amplitude (from max-mag / min-mag-I).
  Rows without a parseable period, or with zero amplitude, are skipped
  (constant stars, supernovae, irregular variables we can't render
  periodically).
- `crossid.txt` — maps foreign-catalogue IDs (`Hip nnnn`, `HD nnnn`, …)
  to GCVS designations. Only `Hip` and `HD` are extracted since AT-HYG
  carries those.

`applyVariability` then walks the post-sort catalog and for each star
tries HIP first, HD fallback, to find a GCVS name, then looks up the
period+amp. Typical match rate: ~3.7k out of 313k classic_ids stars —
most catalog stars aren't variable, but the ones that are tend to be
the astronomically interesting ones (Betelgeuse, Mira, Algol,
Cepheids, etc.).

Both GCVS files are tracked via Git LFS rather than downloaded at build
time — they update rarely (yearly-ish). If bumping to a new GCVS
version, re-download from http://www.sai.msu.su/gcvs/ and replace the
existing files; LFS handles the large-blob storage on push.

## CCDM double-star cross-match

Visual binaries get the same `flags` bit 4 the geometric pass uses, so
chart mode renders wings on either source with no renderer-side
changes. The geometric pass alone yields ~14 pairs (the only AT-HYG
rows where both components survive the classic-IDs cut); the CCDM
pass pulls in everything else where the primary has a HIP — Sirius,
Mizar, Castor, α Cen, Polaris, Albireo, γ And, ε Lyr, etc.

`parseHipCcdm` in `build-catalog.ts` reads `data/hip_ccdm.tsv`, a
three-column slice of the **Hipparcos main catalogue** (VizieR
`I/239/hip_main`). The `CCDM` column on each Hipparcos row carries
the cross-reference into the Catalog of the Components of Double
and Multiple stars (Dommanget & Nys 1994), the curated pre-WDS
register of visual doubles. CCDM alone is too permissive — it
lumps physical pairs together with wide line-of-sight optical
pairs that happen to land near each other on the sky, so flagging
on `CCDM != ""` alone tags Vega, Pollux, and ~19k other stars
including a substantial optical-pair tail.

To gate optical pairs out, we additionally filter on Hipparcos's
own `MultFlag` (H59) column:

| `MultFlag` | Meaning                                | Action |
|------------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| `C`        | Component star in a Hipparcos system   | keep   |
| `G`        | Double resolved within Hipparcos field | keep   |
| `O`        | Orbit known (spectroscopic / astrom.)  | keep   |
| blank      | CCDM listed but Hipparcos didn't model | drop   |
| `V`        | Variability-induced double             | drop   |
| `X`        | Stochastic, low confidence             | drop   |

This drops the bulk of optical pairs while preserving every
binary Hipparcos itself confirmed.

A handful of canonical visual doubles fall through the gate
because Hipparcos modelled them as single stars (`Ncomp=1`,
blank `MultFlag`) — typically wide pairs where the secondary is
faint or angularly outside what Hipparcos resolved.
**`KNOWN_VISUAL_DOUBLES`** in `build-catalog.ts` recovers them
unconditionally. The structure is a list of `{components, reason}`
systems — each entry is one physical system whose `components`
array is the HIPs known to belong to it (one or more) plus a
human-readable justification. The same primary-only flagging that
applies to real CCDM groups applies here, so 61 Cyg A and B share
one entry rather than two and only the brighter (A) gets the
wings glyph. Current list: Polaris (sep 18″ Polaris B), ε¹ Lyr
(inner pair 2.4″), 61 Cyg A+B (the famous nearby K-dwarf pair).
Visual review of new chart-mode renders may surface more — extend
conservatively.

Why this and not TDSC or WDS directly:

- **TDSC** (Fabricius et al. 2002) is built from Tycho-2, which
  saturates on the brightest stars (V ≲ 3) — Sirius, Mizar, Castor,
  α Cen, Polaris are all *missing* from TDSC. CCDM has no such gap.
- **WDS** itself doesn't carry HIP. Doing positional matching
  ourselves would invite false positives in dense fields. CCDM
  side-steps that by giving us the HIP↔system mapping pre-built.

The file is a VizieR TSV fetched once from
`vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/asu-tsv?-source=I/239/hip_main&-out=HIP,CCDM,MultFlag&-out.max=unlimited`
and committed via Git LFS. The parser tolerates VizieR's preamble
(`#` comment lines, header row, dash-separator row). Required
columns are the literal labels `HIP`, `CCDM`, and `MultFlag`; if a
future fetch renames them the build fails with a clear message
naming the actual header that was read.

No separation gate at the per-row level (CCDM and Hipparcos's
`rho` column are both inconsistently populated). The chart-mode
wings glyph is iconic rather than a depiction of resolved pair
geometry, so even Sirius B at ΔV ≈ 10 earns wings on Sirius A.

`parseHipCcdm` returns systems grouped by `CCDM_ID` (real CCDM
strings for file-driven entries, synthetic `OVERRIDE-N` keys for
the `KNOWN_VISUAL_DOUBLES` list). `applyDoublesFlag` then walks
each group, picks the **brightest** catalog member (lowest
`absmag`), and ORs `0x10` onto only that one — so each Hipparcos-
resolved system contributes exactly one chart-mode wings glyph,
matching the geometric pass's mutual-primary semantics. Stars that
are CCDM secondaries do not get the bit; they remain in the
catalog with their other flags intact. No `companionIdx` write —
the secondary often isn't in the AT-HYG classic_ids subset, and
the renderer's zoom-fit code at `stellata.ts` already guards on
`companion ≥ 0`, so a flagged-but-unpaired primary is fine.

If the CCDM file is absent the build logs and continues — the
geometric pass still runs and chart mode still works, just with the
~14-pair coverage.

## Bailer-Jones DR3 distance override

`scripts/build-catalog.ts` swaps AT-HYG's naive `1 / π` distances for
the Bayesian posteriors published by Bailer-Jones et al. 2021 (CDS
I/352). The pipeline:

1. Load `data/bailer-jones-dr3.tsv` via `parseBailerJonesTsv` into a
   `Map<source_id, distance_pc>` keyed by Gaia DR3 `source_id`. The
   key is kept as a **string** — Gaia source_ids regularly exceed
   `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, so any numeric parse would silently
   corrupt the join. Photogeometric `r_med_photogeo` is preferred;
   `r_med_geo` is the fallback when photogeo is absent.
2. During `readStars`, every AT-HYG row with a non-empty `gaia`
   source_id is looked up in the map. On a hit, `applyBailerJonesOverride`
   (in `catalog-pure.ts`) returns the new `{ dist, x, y, z, absmag }`:
   - `x/y/z` via `icrsSphericalToCartesian(ra, dec, bjDist)` —
     matches AT-HYG's own ICRS Cartesian basis so the override slots
     back into the same coordinate space.
   - `absmag = mag − 5·log₁₀(dist / 10)` — recomputed from the
     original apparent magnitude with the new distance. Skipping
     this step would place stars at the new distance but light them
     for the old one, breaking the disc/glow size chain.
3. The override fires for ~99.5% of Gaia-DR3-bearing AT-HYG rows.
   The residual ~0.5% are source_ids absent from the Bailer-Jones
   publication (small G_R2 / HIP / GJ tail) and keep their AT-HYG
   values unchanged.
4. The build also rescues ~15 stars previously dropped at the
   `dist > 50,000 pc` filter: catastrophic-parallax-inversion
   supergiants whose Bayesian distance falls below the cap.

If `data/bailer-jones-dr3.tsv` is absent (fresh clone without LFS
pulled), the build logs and continues — every star keeps its naive
AT-HYG distance.

Data refresh: `scripts/refresh-bailer-jones.py`. See SCIENCE.md
§ Bailer-Jones DR3 distance override for the physics rationale.

## Reference epoch and proper motion

Every stellar layer is a J2000.0 snapshot. The solar system is the
only "now" layer in the scene. The two share a frame orientation
(ICRS axes coincide with the J2000.0 equinox) but not a time.

### Per-layer epoch

| Layer | Epoch | How |
|---|---|---|
| Stars (`x0/y0/z0`) | J2000.0 (epoch + equinox) | AT-HYG's upstream README tags `ra`/`dec` as "epoch + equinox 2000.0". AT-HYG is a merge of Tycho-2, Hipparcos, and Gaia DR3 — Gaia DR3 is natively at J2016.0, so AT-HYG back-propagates Gaia rows to J2000.0 using their PM before tabulating. The catalog binary inherits whatever AT-HYG emitted. |
| GCVS variables | n/a (period + amplitude only) | We never consume GCVS positions; the variable rides on its AT-HYG row via the HIP/HD cross-match, so position inherits J2000.0 transitively. |
| Hipparcos CCDM | n/a (flag-only) | We consume `MultFlag` only, never position. |
| Constellation stick figures | n/a (HIP-indexed) | Stellarium's polylines reference HIP IDs; geometry deforms to wherever AT-HYG places the figure stars, so the line endpoints inherit J2000.0 transitively. |
| Local Group dwarfs | J2000.0 | Pace 2024 LVDB's `ra`/`dec` are J2000.0; the hand-curated overrides (LMC, SMC, M31, M33, Sgr dSph) likewise. Extragalactic distances are large enough that arcsecond-scale tangential drift over decades is invisible. |
| Edenhofer 2023 dust | n/a (spatial grid in ICRS) | The voxel grid is ICRS-axis-aligned, so it shares orientation with everything else. Dust drift over decades is sub-pixel at the grid's 1.25 kpc / 512³ resolution. |
| Solar system | Live UTC each frame | JPL Standish 1992 Keplerian elements evaluated at the current Julian Date; see `docs/solar-system.md` § Time `t` and the readout. |

### `pm_*` columns are loaded into nothing

The AT-HYG CSV carries `pm_ra`, `pm_dec`, and `pm_src` columns.
`scripts/build-catalog.ts` and `scripts/catalog-pure.ts` never read
them — `grep -n 'pm_ra\|pm_dec' scripts/` returns zero hits. The
preprocessor reads only the precomputed Cartesian `x0/y0/z0` triple
and ignores proper-motion data entirely. This is deliberate: no
T-axis animation is currently supported (see SCIENCE.md §
Modelling decisions deliberately not made).

### Staleness consequence

The J2000.0 snapshot is now ~26 years old. For the vast majority of
stars (PM < ~100 mas/yr), the offset between catalog position and
true present-day position is sub-arcsec to a few arcseconds —
invisible at any reasonable FOV. A handful of high-PM neighbours
have visibly drifted, however:

| Star | PM (″/yr) | Offset at J2000 + 26.4 yr |
|---|---|---|
| Barnard's Star | ~10.36 | ~273 ″ ≈ 4.6 arcmin |
| Kapteyn's Star | ~8.67 | ~229 ″ ≈ 3.8 arcmin |
| Groombridge 1830 | ~7.05 | ~186 ″ ≈ 3.1 arcmin |
| Lacaille 9352 | ~6.90 | ~182 ″ ≈ 3.0 arcmin |
| 61 Cygni A | ~5.28 | ~139 ″ ≈ 2.3 arcmin |

At constellation-scale FOV (10–30°) these are tiny but technically
wrong; at close approach or in OBSERVE mode the highest-PM stars
are visibly mis-located.

## Preprocessor idempotency

`scripts/build-catalog.ts isUpToDate` skips rebuild if `catalog.bin`,
`constellations.json`, **and** `search-index.json` are newer than all
source inputs (AT-HYG CSV, Stellarium JSON, GCVS files, Hipparcos
CCDM TSV, and the script itself). If you change field mapping but
not the script mtime (e.g. edit in a way that updates atime only),
you may need to `touch scripts/build-catalog.ts` or delete the
generated files.
