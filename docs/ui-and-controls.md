# UI and controls

The right-side display-settings panel, TrackballControls tuning, the
warp animation, gestures, layout containers, and a few CSS gotchas
that bit hard enough to be worth documenting.

## Reverse-sync in `controls.ts`

Widgets subscribe to `starfield.onFilterChange` and write DOM from the filter
state. This is how URL restores and `naked eye`/`all` presets update sliders
and chip states. **Setting `.value` programmatically does NOT dispatch
`input`**, so there's no feedback loop. If you add a filter field, remember
to handle it in `syncFromFilter`.

## Camera near plane vs controls minDistance

`camera.near = 0.001`, `controls.minDistance = 0.005` (via
`DEFAULT_MIN_DIST_PC`). The near plane must stay **strictly less** than
the closest orbit distance, otherwise a centered star lands on the clip
plane at max zoom and gets culled. If adjusting, keep that invariant.
Per-focus `minDistance` is bumped by `minDistForStar(idx)` when the
focused star has a binary companion, so both components stay in the
vertical viewport half-angle (~25°) at max zoom. Warp end-offset uses
the same per-star value so animated arrivals park at the right distance.
Earlier attempts to zoom closer than 0.005 pc hit float32 precision
jitter when the destination star is far from the world origin.

## TrackballControls tuning

We're using `TrackballControls`, not `OrbitControls`, because the user wants
unbounded orbit past the poles (`OrbitControls` clamps polar angle, stalling
at the zenith/nadir — you'll see `cx=0` in the URL when it happens).

Current settings:
- `rotateSpeed = 3.0` (TBC defaults high; 3 feels natural)
- `zoomSpeed = 1.1`
- `panSpeed = 0.6`
- `dynamicDampingFactor = 0.15` (this is the damping knob; not
  `enableDamping`/`dampingFactor` like OrbitControls)
- `staticMoving = false` (keeps damping on)
- `noPan = false` (right-click pans; set `true` to disable)
- `minDistance = 0.005`, `maxDistance = 100_000`

## Warp animation

An animated camera flight between the focused star (A) and the distance
vector destination (B). Trigger: click the yellow distance label on the
SVG overlay (hovering reveals a "→ Warp" suffix), or press `W`. Skip: the
muted ghost pill at top-center (shown only while warping), or `Esc` /
`Space`. Click-tip-to-travel is an instant teleport that routes through
`focusStar(idx)` for consistency with search-select (2 pc viewing
distance, camera teleports along with the orbit target).

Two-phase animation in `starfield.ts updateWarp`:

1. **Reorient** (`WARP_REORIENT_MS` = 2000). Camera keeps
   `camera.lookAt(A)` locked the whole time; its position spherically
   slerps around A from wherever the user was to `A + dirBack ×
   endOffset` (on the travel line, offset behind A from B's
   perspective). Simultaneously the orbit distance eases linearly from
   `mag0` down to `endOffset`. End state: A is centered and B is
   straight ahead, beyond A. Quaternion slerp is used for the angular
   interp (robust against antipodal starting positions). `endOffset`
   is `minDistForStar(destIdx)` — i.e. per-star, larger for binaries
   so the arrival parks at a distance where both system members fit.

2. **Fly** (log-scaled duration, `WARP_T_MIN_MS` to `WARP_T_MAX_MS`).
   Straight-line lerp from `pStart` (= A + dirBack × endOffset) to
   `pEnd` (= B − forward × endOffset) with a symmetric
   accelerate/decelerate profile: `f(t) = 2t²` for `t < 0.5`, else
   `1 − 2(1−t)²`. `camera.lookAt(B)` throughout.

Scale bar smoothness: `controls.target` is pointed at **B** from the
moment the warp begins (not just at arrival). Camera orientation is
controlled independently via `camera.lookAt`, so the reorient phase can
still keep A centered visually while the scale bar already reflects
distance-to-destination — this avoids a jarring scale-bar snap when the
target would otherwise switch from A to B at arrival.

During warp: `controls.enabled = false` (no orbit), pointer-up click
handling is short-circuited, URL writer skips frame-hash updates (camera
is changing every frame and we don't want to serialise intermediate
poses), and `body.warping` toggles a CSS class that hides the entire
SVG overlay (distance vector, figure, focus ring) since their per-frame
reprojection looks chaotic under fast travel.

Distance-label-as-warp-trigger UI:
`index.html` wraps the distance label and a static `→ Warp` sibling
`<text>` in a `<g id="dist-ui">`. The group has `pointer-events: auto`
and `:hover` reveals the warp suffix via CSS opacity transition. The
label itself is still `text-anchor="middle"` and positioned dead-center
on the measurement vector; the warp suffix is computed each frame as
`mx + label.getComputedTextLength()/2 + WARP_GAP_PX` so the distance
stays visually anchored while the suffix extends to the right.

## Two-finger roll gesture (platform-split)

`starfield.ts` adds a two-finger rotate gesture that rolls the view around
the center of the screen by rotating `camera.up` around the forward vector
(`target - position`). TrackballControls reads `camera.up` every `update()`,
so the new orientation persists through subsequent orbit/zoom without
touching the controls' internals.

Implementation split:

- **Mobile / touch** — listens for `touchstart`/`touchmove` with exactly two
  touches, computes the `atan2` angle between them, and applies the delta
  per move. Single-finger drags are ignored (TrackballControls handles them
  via pointer events, separate from the touch event stream, so there is no
  conflict).
- **Desktop Safari** — listens for the non-standard `gesturestart` /
  `gesturechange` events (WebKit only). `event.rotation` is degrees,
  cumulative since `gesturestart`, positive clockwise. We `preventDefault`
  to suppress Safari's page-level zoom; TrackballControls still receives
  the accompanying wheel events for pinch-zoom.
- **Chrome / Firefox on desktop** — no rotate gesture exists in those
  browsers (two-finger trackpad is scroll-only, pinch fires wheel+ctrlKey
  but no rotation). Roll is unavailable there by design. Do not spend
  effort trying to polyfill it.

Sign convention: finger rotation CW on the screen → world rotates CW.
`rollCamera(-delta)` achieves this because `applyAxisAngle(forward, θ)`
rotates `camera.up` CCW when viewed from behind the forward vector
(standard right-hand rule), and rotating `up` CCW in world space makes
world content appear CW in the camera's view.

## Layout containers: `.ui-top` and `.ui-bottom`

The whole overlay UI is two pure-CSS flex containers — **no breakpoints, no
JS measurements**. An earlier attempt used `ResizeObserver` to drive
`panel.style.top` / `maxHeight`; the user explicitly rejected that ("use
native html/css... we shouldn't dictate layout"). Do not reintroduce it.

- `.ui-top` — fixed top-right, `flex-direction: column`, bottom-bounded.
  Children in DOM order: topbar (brand + search), then panel (display
  settings). Because panel is a flex child below the topbar, it can never
  overlap it — no measurement needed.
- `.ui-bottom` — fixed full-width along the bottom, `flex-wrap: wrap`,
  `align-items: flex-end`. Children: scale-bar (left), meta (right, with
  `margin-left: auto` for pull-apart). When the row doesn't fit, wrap puts
  them on separate rows naturally.
- `.meta` has `overflow-wrap: anywhere` — star names can be long and we
  want them to break within the narrow column when necessary. Layout
  is two stacked `<div>`s: `.meta-focus` (focused-star name ·
  constellation, brighter) above `.meta-count` (catalog total, dimmer).
  Distance-from-Sol used to live in this area but now belongs to the
  Sol locator arrow's label, so the meta no longer carries it.
- Both containers set `pointer-events: none` on themselves and `auto` on
  direct children, so clicks fall through empty regions to the canvas.

## `[hidden]` specificity and `.modal { display: grid }`

The HTML `hidden` attribute maps to `[hidden] { display: none }` in the UA
stylesheet — specificity (0,1,0). `.modal { display: grid }` has the same
specificity (0,1,0), and site stylesheets win ties, so `modal.hidden = true`
had **no visible effect** on the modal. Fixed globally with
`[hidden] { display: none !important; }` in `styles.css`. If you add
another class that sets `display` on an element that may be `hidden`ed
imperatively, you're already covered — but don't remove the `!important`
rule.

## `backdrop-filter` creates stacking contexts

Both `.topbar` and `.panel` use `backdrop-filter: blur(6px)`, which
silently creates a stacking context. Children's `z-index` is then clamped
to that context — so `.search-results` with `z-index: 12` inside `.topbar`
was painted **below** `.panel` (which has no z-index but appears later in
DOM order). Fixed by giving `.topbar` an explicit `z-index: 1` to lift its
whole context above `.panel`. If you add more blurred panels, remember
that every one of them is a new stacking boundary.
